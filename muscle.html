	<p>The Chevrolet Impala is a full-size car built by Chevrolet for model years 1958 to 1985, 1994 to 1996, and 2000 to 2020. The Impala was Chevrolet's popular flagship passenger car and was among the better-selling American-made automobiles in the United States.[7][8]

For its debut in 1958 the Impala was distinguished from other models by its symmetrical triple taillights. The Chevrolet Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for model year 1965, later becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Chevrolet Bel Air and the Chevrolet Biscayne.</p>

<p>The Plymouth Superbird is a highly modified, short-lived version of the Plymouth Road Runner with applied graphic images as well as a distinctive horn sound both referencing the popular Looney Tunes cartoon character the Road Runner. It was the factory's follow-up stock car racing design, for the 1970 season, to the Dodge Charger Daytona of 1969, and incorporated many engineering changes and modifications (both minor and major) garnered from the Daytona's season in competition.[3]

The car's primary rivals were the Ford Torino Talladega and Mercury Cyclone, a direct response to the Mopar aero car.</p>

With a V8 engine, the Rocket offered a relatively scaled-back body, about a foot shorter than its 98-series counterpart.<br> Plus, rumor has it that GM execs actually hated the name “Rocket.” Nevertheless, it was a smash success and the line continued to sell all the way through 1999. </p> 
<p>
While we usually think of the ‘60s when it comes to muscle cars, they never truly went away. Though cars have had to adapt to changing emissions standards and environmental realities,<br> the almighty combustion engine has only gotten more efficient with passing years.
