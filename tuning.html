<p>HKS considers "Tuning" as improvement of vehicle overall performance in response to user needs. When tuning, some users may have some incorrect thought which may lead to them fitting the wrong parts for their needs. For this reason it is important for the user to know "what their target/goal" is and "what parts are needed" to achieve this goal. Here we will explain engine tuning, from light to hard, as simply as possible.</p>
<p>Overall performance puts "safety first" whilst improving the three basics of vehicle performance, "accelerate, turn, decelerate" with the right balance between the three elements. For example, by increasing engine power, inadequacies may be felt in the braking or suspension which were not noticeable before. Also when increasing engine power at high engine speeds (rpm), if the power at low-mid engine speeds remains the same as before, due to the change in power delivery characteristics the driver can feel the illusion that the vehicle has lost power in low-mid engine speeds. Replacing just one part can increase the stress and damage other parts and so it is essential to maintain the correct balance when tuning to increase performance safely.

<p>FIRST WE HAVE CHIP TUNING</p>
<ul>

<li>Stage 1 = chip tuning / tuning box</li>
<li>Stage 2 = Stage 1 + downpipe, intercooler, sports air filter, possibly upgrade turbocharger / upgrade compressor kit</li>
<li>Stage 3 = Stage 1 + Stage 2 + engine reinforcement, complete exhaust system, modified intake / air flow</li>

<img src="images/cd.png" width="450" height="300" float="left">
<p>After installing a performance chip tuning, your car will remain as safe as it was when it left the factory. This also means that your vehicle warranty will remain active. Meets emission standards: Even after installing a performance chip tuning, your vehicle will still meet emission standards.
</p>

<p>•Does chip tuning save fuel?</p>

<p>•With the chip tuning PowerControl, fuel consumption can be reduced by up to 15% with an adapted driving style.</p>

<p>•How Much HP Does a Chip Add?</p>
<p> •Generally, manufacturers claim that their performance chips can give your gasoline engine a performance boost of up to 35 HP. The numbers are even higher for cars with diesel and turbocharged engines

<p>
Can transmissions add HorsePower ?
</p>
<p>
simple transmission upgrades will make sure that your engine can handle more power and have an improved level of performance, as well as average peak power. This, in turn, provides an extra boost in its speed.
</p>

<p>
What is the best racing transmition
</p>
<p>
ATI Powerglide - Superglide 4® Drag Racing Transmission. ATI's new Superglide 4 is the strongest Powerglide in the industry, exclusively from ATI! For use in high horsepower race cars, pullers and monster trucks, the Superglide is available for popular Chevy, Ford, Mopar and Toyota applications!

Supercharger tuning
</p>
<img src="images/qg.png" width="380" height="300" float="left">
<img src="images/qq.png" width="450" height="300" float="left">

<p>
You can expect an engine to gain 20% horsepower from a supercharger – this is about 50 – 100 horsepower depending on the size of your engine.

A supercharger works by compressing the airflow of an engine before entering the engine. As it adds more air, the engine will also be able to combine more fuel. 

Thus, it leads to a bigger boom. It is a great way to give your old car a fresh start.
</p>

<p>
Supercharger works very similarly to a turbocharger. However, a supercharger is powered by the car’s motor. 

Whereas a turbocharger is powered by exhaust gasses – which makes the turbocharger more efficient because it doesn’t use any power from your engine.
</p>

<p>
Horsepower aside, there are many topics surrounding superchargers that you should also know – things like engine damage, costs and  tuning requirements.

Reducing weight
</p>

<img src="images/cb.png" width="380" height="300" float="left">
<img src="images/ws.png" width="380" height="300" float="left">

<p>
It’s a fact – a heavy vehicle moves slower. Reducing the weight of your vehicle increases the weight to horsepower ratio. Examine your vehicle for ways to lower your car’s weight and to up its power.
</p>
<img src="images/df.png" width="380" height="300" float="left">
<img src="images/cv.png" width="380" height="300" float="left">

<p>
Consider swapping out the rims with lighter ones – this can potentially save you 10 pounds per wheel. Changing the battery to a smaller and lighter lithium battery can save 20-30 pounds. Think about replacing body panels with carbon fiber or fiberglass panels to further reduce your vehicle’s weight.
</p>

<p>
Remove parts you deem unnecessary. Not using the backseat? Remove it and the rear seatbelts. Staying cool not as important as performance? Take out the air conditioning unit. Depending on your goals, you need to decide what items are mission critical to your vehicle and which ones you can live without.

High-flow catalytic converter
</p>

<img src="images/qw.png" width="380" height="300" float="left">
<img src="images/xc.png" width="380" height="300" float="left">

<p>
Swapping an old catalytic converter for a high-flow catalyst is another option for adding extra power to your vehicle. Stock catalytic converters may not let gasses flow efficiently, but high-flow catalytic converters use a honeycomb design to up the flow of air.
</p>

<p>
As with the cat-back exhaust, the horsepower gains you experience will largely depend on the catalytic converter that came on your vehicle. If you have an older vehicle with a catalytic converter that is impeding flow, you are more likely to see horsepower gains than if you have a vehicle with a relatively new original catalytic converter.

<img src="images/hj.png" width="380" height="300" float="left">

<p>
Give your engine more air and more power with a cold air intake. Switching your vehicle’s standard air box and filter for a cone-shaped filter and a plastic or aluminum intake tube can help you realize an increase in horsepower.
</p>

<p>
More air equals more combustion which could lead to gains of 5-7 horsepower in a typical engine. Please note that if your vehicle is already getting plenty of fresh air, this won’t help you much.

<h2>The best tuning parts for stock engine</h2>

<img src="images/pipe.png" width="430" height="260">
<p>A downpipe directs the exhaust gases from your vehicle's turbine housing into your exhaust system. The downpipe bolts right to the turbine housing. It is instrumental in moving the exhaust gases through the system as efficiently as possible. The average downpipe has at least one restrictive catalytic converter,
Do downpipes add horsepower? Yes. Performance catted downpipes nowadays have been shown to increase horsepower. An aftermarket downpipe with catalytic converters will add 10 to 20 horsepower on average, and that gain is noticeable anytime the turbo spools.A downpipe exhaust will cost you roughly 200-1000 dollar depending on how much perfomance you want your car to be putting.</p>
<img src="images/intake.png" width="430" height="260">
<p>What Exactly Do Air Intake Systems Do? In the simplest terms, air intake systems bring air from outside the vehicle into your engine's intake manifold, where it is then mixed with fuel from your gas tank.Cold Air Intakes are said to improve your vehicle's performance by 5-20 horsepower. This number will vary depending on the make and model of your vehicle. While this isn't enough power to put you back in your seat, it will give your car or truck a little pep in its step.</p>
<img src="images/spark1.png" width="430" height="260">
<p>Racing spark plugs perform the complicated task of delivering maximum engine power and dissipating heat under these challenging conditions. Our plugs feature a firing end designed to reduce electrode and insulator exposure as much as possible, protecting them from the punishing conditions of a racing engine,
new spark plugs can greatly improve your car's horsepower and overall engine performance. When you change your worn-out spark plug with fresh spark plugs, you'll notice a much faster engine response when driving.
</p>
<img src="images/turbo.png" width="400" height="260">

<p>
What does a turbo do? A turbo compresses exhaust gas as it exits and sends it back into the engine. The increased airflow sends more fuel into the engine, giving it more power.
What is PSI, The pressure is referred to as boost and expressed in pounds per square inch (PSI). A turbocharger may be able to move enough air than the engine can use even at low pressures thereby causing an instant boost that impacts power. The greater the turbo boost pressure, the greater the engine power.
</p>
<img src="images/man.png" width="400" height="260">
<p>
Exhaust manifolds are essential, as they help to channel waste products (exhaust gases) away from the engine so that it can suck in more air to burn.
</p>
<p>
The national cost for an exhaust manifold replacement in 2023 is between $275 and $2065 with an average of $804.
</p>
<p>
Not every combination of vehicle and engine may have enough space to install one, and thus you might be forced to choose between a manifold and a shorty. So how much hp do long tube headers add? If attached to a stock engine, you can expect about 6-9 hp over a manifold.
</p>
<img src="images/aa.png" width="400" height="260">
<p>
A supercharger works by increasing an engine's power and torque. It compresses the air the engine takes in, often called forced induction. Patented by Gottlieb Daimler in 1885, European car models popularized them throughout the 1920s and 1930s.
</p>
<img src="images/cc.png" width="400" height="260">

<p>
No matter the application, the function and purpose of a clutch is to transmit torque from a rotating driving motor to a transmission. Clutches require a mode of actuation in order to break the transmission of torque.
</p>

<p>
Because your engine is always spinning, there has to be a way for the wheels to disengage so they can stop moving. This is where the clutch comes into play. It can disengage the wheels without killing the engine.
</p>

<img src="images/vv.png" width="400" height="260">

<p>
The purpose of coilover springs is to prevent the chassis from bottoming out, support each individual wheel on the vehicle, and mitigate or reduce body roll when taking turns and cornering, particularly at higher speeds. The springs also help to reduce squatting when accelerating and diving when decelerating.
</p>
<img src="images/mf.png" width="400" height="260">

<p>
They aid in dampening vehicle emissions and engine noise. They are made of steel and are coated with aluminum to provide protection from the heat and chemicals released from the exhaust system. Mufflers are used mainly to dissipate the loud sounds created by the engine's pistons and valves.
</p>

<p>
Can you run without a muffler
</p>

<p>
The possibility of toxic exhaust fumes leaking into your car's ventilation system represents the largest reason for not driving with a broken or damaged muffler. You put yourself and others in serious - and potentially fatal - danger if this occurs while you drive.
</p>

<p>
Mufflers' Effect on Performance
</p>

<p>
An engine is able to generate more power, faster if it is able to get rid of all of the exhaust gases it produces quickly. By their nature, mufflers restrict exhaust flow or create back pressure, which slightly slows down your engine.

What is Carbon Fiber
</p>

<p>
Carbon Fiber is a polymer and is sometimes known as graphite fiber. It is a very strong material that is also very lightweight. Carbon fiber is five-times stronger than steel and twice as stiff. Though carbon fiber is stronger and stiffer than steel, it is lighter than steel; making it the ideal manufacturing material for many parts. These are just a few reasons why carbon fiber is favored by engineers and designers for manufacturing.
</p>

<p>
How does Carbon Fiber affect if u use it on cars
</p>

<p>
Carbon fiber is a stronger material than steel, even though it's significantly lighter. In the auto world, carbon fiber is ideal because it lowers the vehicle's weight while still being able to withstand the stresses of racing at high speeds.
</p>

<p>
What are the disadvantages of carbon fibre in cars?
</p>

<p>
The cons of it are definitely the cost. The material is more expensive, because it is more labor and technology intensive. It's gotten more affordable, but is still mainly used in luxury sports cars. Repairs and replacement parts are also expensive with this material.

What is an e-brake and how it affects drifting
</p>

<p>
In front wheel drive drifting, the racer uses the pull up emergency brake for short intervals to cause the loss of rear wheel traction by locking the rear brakes.
