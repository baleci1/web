<p>Japanese domestic market (JDM) refers to Japan's home market for vehicles and vehicle parts.[1] Japanese owners contend with a strict motor vehicle inspection and grey markets.

The average age of JDM cars is 8.7 years, ranking 9th in a survey of 30 of the top 50 countries by gross domestic product.[2] According to the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, a car in Japan travels a yearly average of over only 9,300 kilometers (5,800 miles), less than half the U.S. average of 19,200 kilometers (12,000 miles)</p>

<p>The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".[3]

The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.</p>

	<p>The Nissan 180SX is a fastback automobile that was produced by Nissan Motors between 1988 and 1998. It is based on the S13 chassis from the Nissan S platform with the variants receiving an R designation (ex. PS13 and RPS13), and was sold exclusively in Japan paired with the CA18 motor in the early models; later models paired with the SR20 motor. Outside of Japan, it was re-badged as the 200SX[1] and in the US market as the Nissan 240SX, paired with the single overhead cam KA24E motor and later with the dual-overhead model KA24DE.</p>

<p>The AE86 series of the Toyota Corolla Levin and Toyota Sprinter Trueno are small, front-engine/rear-wheel-drive models within the front-engine/front-wheel-drive fifth generation Corolla (E80) range—marketed by Toyota from 1983 to 1987 in coupé and liftback configurations.

Lending themselves to racing, the cars were light, affordable, easily modifiable and combined a five-speed manual transmission, optional limited slip differential, MacPherson strut front suspension, high revving (7800 rpm), twin-cam engine with oil cooler (e.g., in the US), near 50/50 front/rear weight balance, and importantly, a front-engine/rear-drive layout—at a time when this configuration was waning industry-wide.</p>

<h2>Extra info about Muscle </h2>

<p>
Before the term “muscle car” was even conceived, Oldsmobile shot for the stars with their sporty-yet-powerful Rocket 88. With a V8 engine, the Rocket offered a relatively scaled-back body, about a foot shorter than its 98-series counterpart.<br> Plus, rumor has it that GM execs actually hated the name “Rocket.” Nevertheless, it was a smash success and the line continued to sell all the way through 1999. </p> 
<p>
While we usually think of the ‘60s when it comes to muscle cars, they never truly went away. Though cars have had to adapt to changing emissions standards and environmental realities,<br> the almighty combustion engine has only gotten more efficient with passing years.
